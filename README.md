# 10x Backend Dev Portfolio

I am sick of these cool looking Portfolio sites these frontend and fullstack devs have, partly because im a backend dev.

So this is the Portfolio of a backend dev.
APIS.
Gin.
Go.
Fast.
Goodbye UI/UX, hello curl.

## TODO

- setup query params for other stuff
- do some cool backend stuff, thinking of bouncing a packet around the globe
- setup docker and set up as systemd on vps, setup a subdomain for this


## Notes
HTTP -> handler -> store -> DB -> response
