# 10x Backend Dev Portfolio

I am sick of these cool looking Portfolio sites these frontend and fullstack devs have, partly because im a backend dev.

So this is the Portfolio of a backend dev.
APIS.
Gin.
Go.
Fast.
Goodbye UI/UX, hello curl.

## TODO

- high level system design
- figure out data storage lifecycle, easy way to update data
- figure out path and query params in Gin
- figure out devops pipeline


## Notes
HTTP → handler → service → repo → DB
